        <p>Website design and development has changed significantly over the past decade to bring forth highly interactive and responsive user interfaces we see around the internet. Before a website goes live, designers and developers go through a rigorous process that involves planning, visual designing, development, and testing. Developing a website involves combining several languages that work together to achieve a task. Such languages include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, PHP and more. In this article, we delve into mastering HTML and CSS, but first, let’s understand the architecture of a website.</p>

        <p>A website’s architecture involves two main parts; the front-end (also referred to as client-side) and the back-end (also referred to as the server side). The front-end includes what happens on your browser and what you see when you visit a website. The back-end involves the server-side logic, databases, and data storage, manipulation and retrieval processes. Everything you see on your browser is a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which encompass front-end development. Now that you have a basic understanding of the web architecture, let’s proceed with the article’s scope. To master HTML and CSS, you must first learn the fundamentals.</p>
